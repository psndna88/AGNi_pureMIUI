Simple MSM thermal driver (MSM_THERMAL_SIMPLE)

MSM_THERMAL_SIMPLE is a standalone kernel driver which regulates thermal
conditions on the device in the absence of an equivalent userspace daemon. The
goal of MSM_THERMAL_SIMPLE is to prevent the temperature of the system from
exceeding a thermal limit at which it cannot operate. The MSM_THERMAL_SIMPLE
driver polls a given ADC channel for temperature readings, and reduces the
maximum CPU frequency in steps, to limit power/thermal output when a threshold
temperature is crossed. It restores the maximum CPU frequency in the same
stepwise fashion when the threshold temperature is cleared.

The devicetree representation of the MSM_THERMAL_SIMPLE block should be:

Required properties:
- compatible: "qcom,msm-thermal-simple"

- qcom,thermal-vadc:
	The phandle to the VADC device to use.

- qcom,adc-channel:
	The ADC channel to poll from on the VADC device; a full
	list of valid channels is available in include/linux/qpnp/qpnp-adc.h,
	inside the qpnp_vadc_channels enumeration.

- qcom,poll-ms:
	The amount of time in milliseconds between each polling interval.

- zone@NUM:
	A zone node containing the following properties, where the lowest zone
	node number (NUM) corresponds to the lightest thermal throttle step. An
	unlimited number of zones may be specified. Each zone node should be
	formatted as so:
	- reg:
		The thermal zone number.

	- qcom,silver-khz:
		The frequency limit in kHz for the silver CPU cluster.

	- qcom,gold-khz:
		The frequency limit in kHz for the gold CPU cluster.

	- qcom,trip-deg:
		The temperature corresponding to this zone. The units for this
		are ambiguous; they correspond to whichever units the selected
		ADC channel uses for its output.

Optional properties:
- qcom,start-delay:
	The amount of time in seconds to wait for thermal monitoring to start
	after the driver has initialized. This is useful to avoid thermal
	throttling during boot. By default, this is set to 0.

Example:

	qcom,msm-thermal-simple {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-thermal-simple";
		qcom,thermal-vadc = <&pm8998_vadc>;
		qcom,adc-channel = <0x4c>;
		qcom,poll-ms = <3000>;
		qcom,start-delay = <60>;

		zone@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			qcom,silver-khz = <1766400>;
			qcom,gold-khz = <2246400>;
			qcom,trip-deg = <36000>;
		};

		zone@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			qcom,silver-khz = <1766400>;
			qcom,gold-khz = <2169600>;
			qcom,trip-deg = <37000>;
		};

		zone@2 {
			reg = <2>;
			qcom,silver-khz = <1766400>;
			qcom,gold-khz = <2092800>;
			qcom,trip-deg = <38000>;
		};

		zone@3 {
			reg = <3>;
			qcom,silver-khz = <1766400>;
			qcom,gold-khz = <1996800>;
			qcom,trip-deg = <39000>;
		};
	};
